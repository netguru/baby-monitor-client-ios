#
# This `bitrise.yml` variant contains the default configuration to be used in
# an iOS app repository. You can strip the comments in your `bitrise.yml`, if
# you want.
#
# Scripts in the following `bitrise.yml` file makes use of the following
# environment variables that should be set up as secret:
#
# - `HOCKEYAPP_APP_ID_STAGING`, `HOCKEYAPP_APP_ID_PRODUCTION`: App IDs of
#   staging and production HockeyApp apps.
#
# - `HOCKEYAPP_API_TOKEN_STAGING`, `HOCKEYAPP_API_TOKEN_PRODUCTION`: API tokens
#   used to upload and release builds to HockeyApp app.
#
# - `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: A generic webhook integration URL used to post
#   notifications to Slack.
#
# - `SLACK_CHANNEL` (optional): A target Slack channel to post notifications to.
#   If not present, the default channel of the integration is used.
#
# - `JIRA_DOMAIN` (optional): A domain URL to the JIRA installation, typically a
#   subdomain on `atlassian.net`. If not present, information about JIRA task
#   will not be included in a Slack notification.
#
# - `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY` (optional): A JIRA project key assocciated with the
#   repository. If not present, information about JIRA task will not be included
#   in a Slack notification.
#
# - `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` (optional, but recommended): This can be access token from
#   your GitHub account. Setting up Carthage with access token will allow it to
#   download libraries without hitting API rate limit. This way Carthage step will
#   run faster - if library can be downloaded, Carthage will do that, rather than
#   compiling dependency.
#
# Also, those scripts use the following environment variables that are declared
# publicly in the following file:
#
# - `XCODEBUILD_PROJECT`: A path to a project or a workspace Xcode file.
#
# - `XCODEBUILD_SCHEME`: A name of the scheme to be built.
#
# - `XCODEBUILD_OPTIONS`: Additional build settings passed straight to each
#   `xcodebuild` invocation.
#

# CLI metadata.
#
# This metadata is required to always be in `bitrise.yml`. The `format_version`
# setting will be occasionally bumped.
